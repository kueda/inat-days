<h1>iNat Streaks</h1>

<p>
  Some iNat users keep it regular. Like, really regular. These charts show
  content created over time by users with the most unique days for each content type. 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="observations-observed-on.html">Observation streaks by date observed</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="observations-created-on.html">Observation streaks by date added</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="identifications-created-on.html">Identification streaks by date added</a>
  </li>
</ul>

Some stuff to keep in mind

<ul>
  <li>each visualization can be zoomed in via mouse pad or scroll wheel</li>
  <li>individual dots represent days</li>
  <li>observation counts are only using observations with photos</li>
  <li>
    the rows of each visualization are sorted by number of days for each user,
    so for observations by date added, the user at the top will be the user
    who has added observations to the site on the most unique days.
  </li>
</ul>
